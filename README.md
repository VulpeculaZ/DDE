Parameters Estimation for Delay Differential Equations (DDE).
===
### Usage:
R functions to estimate parameters of DDEs with noisy data are presented here. It requires the **CollocInfer** package to function and provides a few wrapper functions to adapt to the task for estimating parameters of DDEs. Only least squares (normal measurement error) is supported for now.

Examples for delayed vector disease model and delayed SIR model are provided.
